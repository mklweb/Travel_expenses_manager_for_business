# Travel expenses manager for business

###Business travel expenses and credit card manager

This is an academic project developed in a group by Agustín Sardón and Mikel Oceja for Maristak Ikastetxea in June 2020.
The project is a native mobile application for android developed. It has been developed in Android Studio.

- It allows the management of expenses and subsistence allowance for the company's workers. The worker can create new expenses or allowances, consult previous records, modify or delete them.
- It offers the possibility of managing company cards. Maristak provided us with a webservice that simulates the bank.
The app can access that webservice so we can make queries and activate / deactivate the cards.
When activating and deactivating cards, we perform a geolocation validation, preventing the worker from activating a card if it is not in the territorial scope of the card.
